Boom boom acka-lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom

It was a night like this forty million years ago
I lit a cigarette, picked up a monkey skull to go
The sun was spitting fire, the sky was blue as ice
I felt a little tired, so I watched Miami Vice
And walked the triceratops, I walked the triceratops

Chorus:

Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the triceratops
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the triceratops
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the triceratops
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody walk the triceratops

I met you in a cave, you were painting buffalo
I said I'd be your slave, follow wherever you go
That night we split a rattlesnake and danced beneath the stars
You fell asleep, I stayed awake and watched the passing cars
And walked the triceratops, I walked the triceratops

Chorus

One night I dreamed of New York
You and I roasting blue pork
In the Statue of Liberty's torch
Elvis landed in a rocket ship
Healed a couple of leapers and disappeared
But where was his beard?????

A shadow from the sky much too big to be a bird
A screaming crashing noise louder than I've ever heard
It looked like two big silver trees that somehow learned to soar
Suddenly a summer breeze and a mighty lion's roar
I killed the triceratops, I killed the triceratops

Chorus 2:

Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the triceratops
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the triceratops
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the triceratops
Open the door, get on the floor
Everybody kill the triceratops
Repeat chorus 2 one time
Boom boom acka-lacka lacka boom
Boom boom acka-lacka boom boom
